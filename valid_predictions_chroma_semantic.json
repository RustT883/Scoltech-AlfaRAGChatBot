    "pred_response": "Based on the provided definitions and terms, transferring money to an e-wallet would generally be considered a quasi-cash transaction. This is because:\n\n1. **Quasi-Cash Transaction Definition**: While not explicitly defined in the given text, we can infer that a quasi-cash transaction involves converting funds from a bank account or prepaid card into another form of value (like an e-wallet) without immediate spending.\n\n2. **E-Wallets and Quasi-Cash**: Transferring money to an e-wallet typically involves moving funds from one financial instrument (e.g., a debit card, bank account) to an electronic wallet, which is often used for future purchases or as a digital form of cash.\n\n3. **Fee Classification**: The text mentions that transfers \"To a card of another bank — 1.95%, minimum 30 ₽\" and \"By phone number via the Faster Payments System (FPS) — free up to 100,000 ₽/month.\" These fees suggest that such transactions are subject to specific rules, which align with how quasi-cash transactions are typically handled.\n\nTherefore, transferring money to an e-wallet would likely be classified as a quasi-cash transaction and would incur the applicable fee of 1.95% (minimum 30 ₽) when done via card-to-card transfer or through the Faster Payments System."
