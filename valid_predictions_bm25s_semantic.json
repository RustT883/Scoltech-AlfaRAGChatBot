However, I can provide some general information about the security features typically associated with MIR:\n\nMIR (Mastercard International Rupees) is a national payment card brand used primarily in Russia and some other CIS countries. It operates under Mastercard's global security standards but has its own unique infrastructure.\n\nKey security features of MIR include:\n1. 3D Secure: An authentication protocol to protect online transactions\n2. Tokenization: Used for contactless payments to reduce risk of card data exposure\n3. Fraud monitoring systems: To detect and prevent unauthorized transactions\n4. PIN-based transactions: For added security on physical cards\n\nCompared to other international payment networks, MIR generally has similar levels of security measures in place. However, the overall safety also depends on factors like:\n- Merchant security practices\n- Cardholder behavior \n- Regulatory environment in Russia\n- Implementation and maintenance of security protocols by banks issuing MIR cards\n\nFor a definitive answer about whether MIR is \"safer\" than other systems, you would need to compare specific security metrics and performance data between MIR and competing payment networks. The safety ultimately depends on how well all parties (card issuers, merchants, etc.) implement and maintain their security measures.\n\nIf you're looking for a direct comparison of safety between MIR and another system, please provide more context or specify the alternative system you'd like to compare it against."
