Deciding to take a personal loan \u2013 a responsible decision A personal loan is a loan provided by a bank for the purchase of goods (works, services) for personal, household, or other non-production-related needs. Obtaining a loan involves the obligation to repay, within the timeframes established by the loan agreement, the principal amount (the sum received from the bank), as well as interest for the use of the loan. Loan agreements often also include obligations to make other payments associated with obtaining and repaying the loan, both to the bank (e.g. fees for reviewing loan documents, opening and maintaining a bank account, transferring funds, etc.) and to third parties (e.g. payments related to insurance, collateral agreements, money transfers through postal services or other banks, etc.). If any payments stipulated by the loan agreement are not made, or are made late and/or not in full, the bank may demand a penalty (fine, interest). The bank\u2019s right to demand such a penalty is usually stated in the loan agreement. Before deciding to take a personal loan, assess your actual need for the loan and your ability to service it on time\u2014that is, how much money you can realistically allocate from your budget to make all required payments under the loan agreement.", "metadata": {}}

Important! Your right to receive timely (prior to signing the loan agreement), necessary, and accurate information is enshrined in federal law (Article 10 of the Law of the Russian Federation \"On Protection of Consumer Rights\", Article 30 of the Federal Law \"On Banks and Banking Activity\"). This information includes: the loan amount, repayment schedule, the full cost of the loan as an annual percentage rate (this includes your loan-related payments as defined in the agreement, including payments to third parties listed in the agreement). Carefully review the lending terms. Pay attention to any references to the bank\u2019s service fees. Request and study information about these fees from the bank employees.
