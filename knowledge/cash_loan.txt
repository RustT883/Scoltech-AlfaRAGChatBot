How to get your money if there's an overpayment on your account
You can withdraw the remaining funds from an ATM, use them to pay for a purchase, or transfer them in the mobile app to another card or mobile phone: Payments → Transfer method.

Why the full repayment amount is higher than the loan amount
Interest is charged on the full loan amount immediately after it is issued. Therefore, when you repay early, the loan amount includes the interest that has already been accrued up to that moment.

Requirements for getting a loan
You are eligible for a loan if:
• You are a Russian citizen over 21 years old
• Your regular income is at least 10,000 ₽ after taxes
• You have an official continuous employment history of at least 3 months  

Documents needed for a cash loan
If your salary is credited to an Alfa-Bank card
Only a Russian passport is required.  
If you do not have an Alfa-Bank salary card
For loans up to 300,000 ₽, only a Russian passport is needed.
For loans over 300,000 ₽, you will also need a 2-NDFL certificate for the last 3 months or a certificate in the bank's format.

How to get the money once the loan is approved
After your loan is approved, we’ll send the loan agreement and payment schedule to your email. You can sign the agreement with an electronic signature. After that, our employee will deliver a free debit card with the loan amount already credited.  
If you already have an Alfa-Bank card, we’ll link the loan to it and credit the money.  
You can also visit any Alfa-Bank branch to sign the agreement. There, you'll receive a free debit card with the loan amount in the account.

You can withdraw cash from this card at an ATM, make purchases, or transfer money in the mobile app.
