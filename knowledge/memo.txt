MEMO
FOR CONSUMERS OF PERSONAL LOANS

I. Deciding to take a personal loan – a responsible decision
A personal loan is a loan provided by a bank for the purchase of goods (works, services) for personal, household, or other non-production-related needs.
Obtaining a loan involves the obligation to repay, within the timeframes established by the loan agreement, the principal amount (the sum received from the bank), as well as interest for the use of the loan.
Loan agreements often also include obligations to make other payments associated with obtaining and repaying the loan, both to the bank (e.g. fees for reviewing loan documents, opening and maintaining a bank account, transferring funds, etc.) and to third parties (e.g. payments related to insurance, collateral agreements, money transfers through postal services or other banks, etc.).
If any payments stipulated by the loan agreement are not made, or are made late and/or not in full, the bank may demand a penalty (fine, interest). The bank’s right to demand such a penalty is usually stated in the loan agreement.
Before deciding to take a personal loan, assess your actual need for the loan and your ability to service it on time—that is, how much money you can realistically allocate from your budget to make all required payments under the loan agreement.

II. Carefully study all information about the loan
and the terms of its servicing (repayment)
To make an informed decision about taking a personal loan, you should receive from bank employees complete information about the terms of the loan, including all payments associated with obtaining and servicing (repaying) the loan—without exception.
Important! Your right to receive timely (prior to signing the loan agreement), necessary, and accurate information is enshrined in federal law (Article 10 of the Law of the Russian Federation "On Protection of Consumer Rights", Article 30 of the Federal Law "On Banks and Banking Activity").
This information includes: the loan amount, repayment schedule, the full cost of the loan as an annual percentage rate (this includes your loan-related payments as defined in the agreement, including payments to third parties listed in the agreement).
Carefully review the lending terms. Pay attention to any references to the bank’s service fees. Request and study information about these fees from the bank employees.
To make the best decision, consider reviewing offers from several banks that provide personal loans. This information will help you compare loan terms across banks.

III. Carefully study the loan agreement
and other documents
Do not rush to sign the documents. Before signing the loan agreement, study it thoroughly. If possible, take the agreement home to study it more carefully. Pay close attention to the clauses that define your obligations (duties, liabilities), and make sure the agreement does not contain any terms that you are unaware of or do not fully understand.
If any lending terms are unclear to you, request explanations and relevant documents from bank employees—ask any questions that concern you.
If you do not receive sufficient clarification, it is better to postpone the decision to take the loan.
We also recommend reporting this issue to ___ (insert name of the local office of the Bank of Russia) at the address: ______ (insert address of the local office of the Bank of Russia).
Your feedback will contribute to improving the quality of supervision over banks and enhancing their performance.
When submitting a loan application to the bank, keep in mind that this application may be considered your offer to enter into a loan agreement under the terms specified in the application.
Acceptance of this application by the bank constitutes a loan agreement without additional notification to you.
After reviewing the loan agreement, carefully weigh all the pros and cons of obtaining the loan and objectively assess your ability to repay it on time and fulfill all related payment obligations.

IV. Signing the loan agreement –
the most crucial stage
Important! By signing the loan agreement (or offer application), you agree to all its terms and accept the obligations set out in it, including repaying the principal on time and paying all amounts due.
If you fail to meet these obligations (or perform them improperly), the bank may take legal action against you.
Only sign the loan agreement (or any other bank documents) if you are confident that you understand all its terms, clearly know what payments you must make and when, and are certain that you will be able to meet these obligations.
