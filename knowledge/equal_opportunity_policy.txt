Equal Opportunity Policy

Why It Matters
At Alfa-Bank, we recognize the unconditional right of every individual to respectful treatment, decent working conditions, and equal opportunities for growth. We value each person’s uniqueness, and the diversity of perspectives, experiences, and knowledge.
It is important for us to ensure equal opportunities for everyone, regardless of gender, age, racial or ethnic background, religion, or many other characteristics. We do not tolerate any form of discrimination.

This policy applies to all bank employees, including managers at all levels, as well as business partners—suppliers, contractors, and other stakeholders.
We have implemented leading international practices to combat inequality. These practices are used in our daily work and are constantly being improved.
The principles of this policy take into account and complement the provisions of other internal bank documents: the corporate ethics code, the human rights protection policy, the HR policy, and the occupational health and safety policy.
Alfa-Bank’s Equal Opportunity Policy outlines our values, principles, and how this policy is applied in practice.

Our Principles
Creating equal opportunities for everyone is impossible without an inclusive work environment. We urge employees and business partners to follow several important principles:


We are responsible for ensuring that our employees do not demonstrate discriminatory or dismissive behavior toward one another, clients, partners, and other stakeholders.


We do not tolerate violations of human dignity or any form of harassment, including physical (including sexual) or moral.


We strive to create and maintain a culture of mutual respect among employees, clients, partners, and other stakeholders.


We value every employee equally regardless of their type of employment or work schedule, including employees on parental leave.


We respect and value employees and clients with disabilities and aim to create an inclusive environment that is comfortable for everyone.


In hiring, we are guided by principles of equality, gender and cultural diversity, and intolerance of any discrimination. We consider internal candidates on an equal basis with external applicants and make decisions based on professional qualifications and experience.


We make decisions on appointments and compensation based on knowledge, experience, and skills. Favoritism and selective promotion—including based on family ties—are unacceptable.


We guarantee equal pay for equal work and do not allow pay discrimination based on gender, age, or any other attribute.


Employees returning from parental leave have the same career development opportunities as all other employees.


We provide equal access to events, training, and opportunities for professional and personal development, making decisions solely based on knowledge, experience, and skills.


We want everyone to be heard. We organize teamwork in such a way that employees can openly express their opinions and voice concerns or difficulties.


We strive to increase diversity at all levels of the organization, including increasing the proportion of women in leadership positions.
