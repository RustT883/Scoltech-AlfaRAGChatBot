Human Rights Protection Policy

Why It Matters
We adhere to the principles of unconditional respect for and protection of human rights and freedoms, and we do not tolerate discrimination against our employees, clients, or partners.
We guarantee the observance of human rights, including the right to life, liberty, personal security, freedom of thought, speech, and conscience. We ensure the protection of human rights for everyone, regardless of socio-cultural background, gender, age, language, religion and beliefs, sexual orientation, social or professional status, or any other characteristic. This principle applies to all areas of our activities and to all employees.

We also believe it is important that human rights are respected throughout our supply chain. Therefore, we apply similar requirements to suppliers and other business partners.

This policy reflects our official position on human rights protection. It should be considered alongside the Corporate Code of Ethics, the Equal Opportunities Policy, the Supplier Code of Conduct, and other applicable corporate documents of Alfa-Bank.

We have implemented the best international practices in the field of human rights protection and apply them in our daily work.

Our Values
Our approach to human rights protection is based on the following principles:

Prohibition of Discrimination, Harassment, Forced and Child Labor

Respect for Local Community Cultures
We respect and take into account the cultural characteristics, values, and customs of people in the regions where we operate.

Respect for the Right to Freedom of Association and Formation of Trade Unions
We consider it essential to ensure employees' rights to freedom of assembly and association, freedom of opinion, and expression. Our employees have the right to establish trade unions or other associations and to join or not to join them.
