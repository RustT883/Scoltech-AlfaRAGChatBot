What is a debit card for?
• Pay for purchases. You can pay with your card anywhere that has a terminal. You can also pay for purchases or subscriptions online or in a mobile app. For payments made with an Alfa-Bank debit card, you can earn bonuses, miles, or cashback up to 100%.
• Transfer money to your own or other accounts — for example, to repay a friend or chip in for a gift for a colleague. Transfers can be made card-to-card, by account details, or by phone number via the Faster Payments System.
• Pay bills — for utilities, internet, or mobile balance top-ups.
• Withdraw cash at ATMs.
• Receive salary, pensions, or government benefits.

How does a non-personalized card differ from a regular one?
A non-personalized card is the same as a regular Alfa debit card: it's free, allows fee-free transfers and payments, and offers up to 100% cashback in the Super Cashback drum, and 5% cashback in 4 categories or 3 categories + 1% on everything. But the main advantage is that you can start using it much sooner: pick it up at a branch in 10 minutes without prior order. If you need delivery — we’ll bring it the same day.

How is a debit card different from a credit card?
A debit card only holds your own money. A credit card, on the other hand, has a limit — a sum you can borrow from the bank if you run out of funds, which you then repay. That’s not possible with a debit card. If you don’t currently have a credit card, we can offer you an installment plan of up to 100,000 rubles for daily expenses — details available in the mobile app.

What can you do in the app?
Transfer money and pay online
Send money by card number or phone number to other banks without commission, within limits. You can always find card details for online purchases in the app.
Exchange currency
If you’re saving in foreign currency — exchange it at a favorable rate.
Earn cashback
Get cashback for purchases and convert it into rubles in the “All Your Cashback” section. 1 point = 1 ruble. If your card accumulates miles, details are also available in that section.
Under “History,” you can see how much you’ve earned from each purchase. Sometimes, details appear a few days after the transaction.
We’ve also gathered partner offers with increased cashback and discounts — find them in the “Showcase” section.
Apply for anything: from insurance to car loans
Open an investment account, apply for a loan or insurance — all without visiting a branch.
Get statements and certificates
Transaction statements, account balance certificates, debt-free certificates for embassies, and even details of enforcement actions — all right in the app.
Save for anything
Renovations, vacations, or a new phone: create a savings goal and achieve it.
Pay fines
Add your car number in the app to receive instant notifications about fines and pay them with a 50% discount.
Open deposits and accounts
Block and reissue cards, open deposits and savings accounts in rubles or foreign currencies — all online.
Split bills with friends
Send a link to friends or colleagues to split a restaurant bill or chip in for a gift for your boss.

How to use Alfa-Online?
Alfa-Online is a mobile banking site that works on all smartphones. It’s just like the app, but you don’t need to download it.
Add the icon to your home screen:
- Open Alfa-Online in Safari.
- Tap Share at the bottom of the screen.
- Choose “Add to Home Screen.”
- Log in using your card number.
- Create a username and password.
- Tap “Save Password” so you don’t have to enter it every time.

Quasi-cash commission
No commission is charged for quasi-cash transactions if:
• The purchase is under 500 ₽
• You use one of the following service packages: Maximum Ultra, Maximum Free, Maximum Ultra Free, Premium, A-Club
• You have the Maximum+ package for personalized and benefit cards
• The transaction is with stock brokers or dealers
• The transaction is with Stoloto  
In all other cases, the commission is 1.99%, minimum 199 ₽.
The bank identifies a quasi-cash transaction by the MCC code assigned to the seller, based on what they sell. That’s why you won’t get a notification about the fee at the time of payment — it’s charged after the transaction.

What are quasi-cash transactions?
Quasi-cash transactions include transfers to e-wallets, payment for traveler's checks, casino settlements, cryptocurrency purchases, lottery ticket purchases, transfers to bookmakers or traders, and other operations where you're essentially buying money.
A commission may be charged for such operations.

How to reissue or block a card?
If your card stops working, you can reissue it via the app, Alfa-Online, or the contact center:
• +7 495 788 88 78 (Moscow and region)
• 8 800 200 00 00 (other regions)  
Cost: 290 ₽; free with the Premium tariff.
You don’t need to reissue your card due to expiration — its validity has been extended until December 2028. For online payments, use the old expiration date.
Note: some stores haven’t updated their terminals, so payments may be declined. In that case, simply order a new card.
If your card is lost, you can block and reissue it yourself in the app or Alfa-Online. If you find the card later, unblock it in the same way and use it again.

Can’t pick up the card at the scheduled time or place?
Change the delivery time and address in the mobile app, Alfa-Online, or call:
• +7 495 788 88 78 (Moscow and region)
• 8 800 200 00 00 (other regions)
If you want to switch from branch pickup to courier delivery or vice versa, call the contact center — we’ll help.
You can track when your card will be ready in the mobile app or via the link we’ll send by SMS or push notification.

What is contactless payment and how to enable it?
Contactless payment lets you pay by simply tapping your card on a terminal.
If you have a Visa or Mastercard, insert the card into an ATM and enter your PIN — usually just checking your balance is enough. Be aware: ATMs of other banks may charge a fee.
For Mir cards, contactless payment is enabled by default.
Important: if you plan to make your first payment on a plane, pre-activate the card by checking the balance or withdrawing cash — this saves the PIN to the card.

How to activate the card?
In the mobile app or Alfa-Online: All my products → Card account → Set a PIN code.

Can I use Alfa-Bank cards to pay with my phone?
If you have an Android smartphone, you can add your Mir card to the Mir Pay and Samsung Pay apps. It's not yet possible on Apple smartphones, but we're working on a solution.
Mir Pay works abroad in Armenia, Kyrgyzstan, and Kazakhstan at the same banks that accept the plastic Mir card.

Can I withdraw dollars or euros from third-party ATMs abroad?
No, but you can withdraw the local currency and exchange it at a currency exchange office.

In which banks can I withdraw cash?
You can make purchases and withdraw cash at the following:

Armenia — in all banks participating in the ArCa payment system.  
Tajikistan — in all banks participating in the Express Pay payment system (Dushanbe City).  
Belarus — in all banks participating in the BELKART payment system, as well as VTB Belarus.  
Abkhazia — in banks participating in the APRA payment system.  
South Ossetia — at the National Bank of the Republic of South Ossetia.  
Kyrgyzstan — in all banks participating in the ELCART payment system.


My transaction is not going through in a bank that should support Alfa-Bank cards
We can't guarantee transaction success — it depends on the settings of the terminals or ATMs of other banks. Try withdrawing money from a different ATM.

Where can I use a debit card abroad?
You can withdraw cash or pay with the Mir card in Abkhazia, Armenia, Belarus, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, and South Ossetia.
Acceptance and servicing of Mir cards in a particular country depends on the policy of foreign banks. It's important to remember they may stop accepting Mir cards. To avoid this, it's better to withdraw cash in advance from an ATM.
Note: Transactions abroad are processed in local currency, so the Mir payment system will convert the amount at its own rate with a 4.9% markup. Make sure there's enough money in the account for the conversion, including the commission.
If you don’t have a local currency account, link your card to a ruble account — this will eliminate double conversion. You can check the exchange rate on the Central Bank website.
If we detect frequent suspicious purchases or cash withdrawals, we may call you to confirm that it's you using the card. But remember: we will never ask for your card number or the digits on the back of the card.

Where can I use a debit card?

Anywhere there's a payment terminal: in cafes, stores, salons, pharmacies, hospitals, cinemas. If there’s no terminal, you can withdraw cash from the nearest ATM, transfer money to the seller’s card via the mobile app, or pay via QR code.  
Online: You can use your debit card for online purchases and link it to services like taxis, streaming platforms, and more. Once the card is linked, you won’t need to enter the number each time — payment will go through automatically.


What payment systems do you issue cards for?
We issue Mir, Mastercard, and Visa cards. You can see which one is available to you in the mobile app, Alfa-Online, or on our website.

What purchases don’t earn cashback?

Important: If you have overdue credit debt, cashback will go to your bonus account, but you won't be able to spend it until the debt is repaid.

Cashback limitations

The maximum cashback per month with the Alfa-Card with Benefits is 5,000 Alfa points, and with the Alfa Premium Card under the Premium tariff — 15,000 Alfa points.  
The maximum transaction amount eligible for cashback is 100,000 rubles for a regular card and 500,000 rubles for a premium card.  
When calculating cashback, we round the purchase amount down to the nearest hundred. For example, if you paid 2,340 rubles in a supermarket, we will count it as 2,300 rubles.  
Bonus points are calculated and displayed in the mobile app 2 days after settlement — you’ll see them when the clock icon disappears next to the purchase.  
If a purchase is returned or partially canceled, the cashback amount will be adjusted in the reporting period when it happened.


What is cashback?
With the Alfa-Card, you can get part of your spending back in rubles every month. The more you spend, the more cashback you receive — that's what cashback is.
You can check your earnings in the Your Total Cashback section in the mobile app or Alfa-Online.
Cashback for regular purchases is credited on the 10th of the following month — for example, September purchases will be credited on October 10. Promotions are credited according to their specific terms.

How to get certificates for a debit card
You can obtain certificates in the mobile app:
Card account → Certificates and statements.

Where to find the referral link and track rewards for invited friends?
You can find the link on the home screen of the mobile app or in Alfa-Online:
Money for you and your friends → Debit card → Recommend.
In the same section, you can check the history of your referrals and the status of your rewards.
If you can't access it, please update the app to the latest version.

How to receive money for recommending a debit card?
Invite a friend or acquaintance to Alfa-Bank, and both of you will get rewarded.
It's simple: you send your personal referral link to a friend, and they use it to order and receive a card, then make a purchase of any amount.
Bonuses will be credited by the end of the next month.
You can earn up to 50,000 rubles per month from debit card referrals.
You won’t be able to recommend if:
• your friend already has a debit card, an active application for one, or a current account with Alfa-Bank,
• your friend has previously applied for a debit card via a recommendation,
• your friend closed their account less than 90 days ago.

Aeroflot Miles
The Aeroflot Alfa-Bank card allows you to join the Aeroflot Bonus program and earn miles for purchases.
When the card is issued, we register you in the bonus program, so miles are credited automatically.
To check and spend your miles, activate your personal account at aeroflot.ru in the Aeroflot Bonus → Join the Program section.
Until then, miles will just accumulate. Purchases can only be paid for entirely with miles.
• For non-premium World cards:
  • Spending over 10,000 ₽ — 1.1 miles for every 60 ₽, $1, €1
  • Spending over 100,000 ₽ — 1.5 miles for every 60 ₽, $1, €1
• For premium World Black Edition cards:
  • Spending over 10,000 ₽ — 1.25 miles for every 60 ₽, $1, €1
  • Spending over 150,000 ₽ — 2 miles for every 60 ₽, $1, €1
For Standard, Gold, Platinum, and World debit cards, no miles are credited for purchases over 50,000 ₽.
For example, if you buy a fridge for 60,000 ₽, miles will be credited only for 50,000 ₽.
For the World Black Edition debit card, no miles are credited for purchases over 500,000 ₽.
For example, if you buy a car for 600,000 ₽, miles will be credited only for 500,000 ₽.
Miles are credited for purchases abroad.
To accumulate and use the program bonuses, you must take a flight with Aeroflot, Nordavia, or another SkyTeam airline within two years of registration in Aeroflot Bonus.
Bonuses include:
• upgraded service class for Aeroflot flights,
• premium air ticket with Aeroflot or another SkyTeam airline,
• premium services from Aeroflot Bonus partners — for example, double miles for electronics or discounts at pharmacy chains.
Important: if you do not fly with Aeroflot, Nordavia, or SkyTeam airlines within two calendar years, all accrued miles will expire.
Purchases with co-branded bank cards do not count in this case.

What is the cash withdrawal fee at branches?
When withdrawing cash at a branch:
You can withdraw cash for free at an ATM. If you withdraw at a cashier, a fee applies:
• Up to 350,000 ₽ — 1.99%, minimum 990 ₽
• Over 350,000 ₽ — 990 ₽  
Important: if the money has been in your account for less than 30 days, a fee will be charged regardless of the amount.
You can clarify the exact fee based on your tariff at a branch or by phone:
+7 495 78-888-78 (Moscow and region), 8 800 200 00 00 (other regions).

Transaction limits
Each bank client has limits on certain types of transactions.
You can check them in the mobile app: tap your name on the home screen → Limits.
These include limits on cash withdrawals, payments, and transfers — all for your security.
Features of the cash withdrawal limit:
• It is shared across all cards and accounts and does not depend on the tariff.
• When issuing a cash loan or refinancing, the limit is increased by the loan amount for 30 calendar days, after which it returns to the previous value.
• If you take out two cash loans in one month, the limit is increased only by the amount of the first one.
• In refinancing, the limit increases by the amount you receive above the old loan’s debt.

What are the fees for other services?
• Balance inquiry at a third-party ATM: 59 ₽, at a partner ATM: 30 ₽, at our ATM: free.
  Partner banks: Gazprombank, Promsvyazbank, Rosselkhozbank, UBRiR, Otkritie, MKB, and Rosbank.
• Card servicing:

  Older tariffs may include a fee — check in the mobile app or Alfa-Online.
  Payroll clients may have special terms — ask your manager.
• Tariff fee:
  Current non-premium cards are issued without a linked tariff, so no fee is charged.
  Older tariffs may involve a fee — check and change your tariff via the contact center:
  +7 495 788 88 78 (Moscow and region), 8 800 200 00 00 (other regions).

• To Sberbank accounts without FPS — 1.95% of the transfer amount.
By account details: 99 ₽ per transfer. Free for Premium tariff.

Why didn’t I receive cashback?
• The item was returned or the purchase was canceled.
• You didn’t click the partner offer button.
• The cashback period hasn’t arrived yet — usually paid on the 10th, but the partner may have its own schedule.
• You purchased items that were already in your cart. Clear your cart before shopping and add items again after clicking Go to shopping.
• You missed a condition: some offers are valid only in specific cities or require a minimum purchase amount.

How to receive cashback from partners?
Go to the partner’s offer page and read the terms carefully.
You can find all offers in the mobile app or Alfa-Online in the Partner Offers section.
Make your purchase according to all the cashback rules.
It’s best to disable your VPN, as it can prevent some offers from working.
Cashback is credited on the 10th of each month.
There are no limits on our side, but the partner may have a cap — see details in the offer card.

How to Order a Card
You can order a debit card online:
• On the website. Choose the one that suits you, click "Order a card," and enter your details. We'll open the account immediately — you can start transferring money via the mobile app or paying for online purchases the same day. The physical card will be delivered within a few days.
• In the mobile app. If you already have an account with our bank, order a card in the mobile app: All My Products → New Account or Product.

What is an SBP Transfer?
A transfer through the Fast Payment System (SBP) is a phone number-based transfer to a card of any Russian bank. The money is credited instantly.
The commission for SBP transfers is 0 ₽, even if you transfer more than 100,000 ₽ per month.

Where You Can Pay with a Debit Card
• At any location that has a terminal: cafes, stores, salons, pharmacies, hospitals, cinemas. If there is no terminal, you can withdraw cash from a nearby ATM or transfer money to the seller’s card using the mobile app.
• Online. You can use your debit card to pay for online purchases and link it to online services — like taxis, streaming platforms, and others. If the card is linked, there’s no need to enter its number each time; payments will go through automatically.

Ruble Transfers
Alfa-Bank offers three types of transfers:
Card-to-card. Transfers to other Alfa-Bank clients are free, and we also won’t charge a fee for transfers to other banks if you enable the “Free Payments” service: the first two months are free, then it’s free if you spend at least 10,000 ₽ per month or pay 149 ₽. Usually, funds arrive within two minutes; in rare cases, it may take up to two days — depending on the recipient’s bank.
By account details. The commission is 0 ₽ for everyone — again, with the “Free Payments” service enabled. Such transfers usually take a few hours, rarely up to 3 business days.
By phone number. These are instant and also commission-free.
You can transfer money from the app’s main screen or: Payments → Transfer Method. If you top up another bank's card using an Alfa-Bank debit card in their app, we’ll charge 1.95% of the amount, minimum 30 ₽.

Quasi-Cash Fee
We won’t charge a fee for quasi-cash transactions in these cases:
• Purchases under 500 ₽
• If you’re using the service packages: Maximum Ultra, Maximum Free, Maximum Ultra Free, Premium, or A‑Club
• With the Maximum+ package for privileged and personalized cards
• At exchange brokers and dealers
• At Stoloto
In all other cases, we charge 1.99% of the amount, minimum 199 ₽.
A quasi-cash transaction is determined by the MCC code assigned to the merchant based on what they sell. Therefore, you won’t see the fee at the moment of purchase — we’ll deduct it afterward, once we identify the merchant’s MCC code.

How to Enable Contactless Payment
To enable contactless payment, insert your card into an ATM and complete any operation that requires a PIN — for example, check your card balance.

How to get your money if there's an overpayment on your account
You can withdraw the remaining funds from an ATM, use them to pay for a purchase, or transfer them in the mobile app to another card or mobile phone: Payments → Transfer method.

Why the full repayment amount is higher than the loan amount
Interest is charged on the full loan amount immediately after it is issued. Therefore, when you repay early, the loan amount includes the interest that has already been accrued up to that moment.

Requirements for getting a loan
You are eligible for a loan if:
• You are a Russian citizen over 21 years old
• Your regular income is at least 10,000 ₽ after taxes
• You have an official continuous employment history of at least 3 months  

Documents needed for a cash loan
If your salary is credited to an Alfa-Bank card
Only a Russian passport is required.  
If you do not have an Alfa-Bank salary card
For loans up to 300,000 ₽, only a Russian passport is needed.
For loans over 300,000 ₽, you will also need a 2-NDFL certificate for the last 3 months or a certificate in the bank's format.

How to get the money once the loan is approved
After your loan is approved, we’ll send the loan agreement and payment schedule to your email. You can sign the agreement with an electronic signature. After that, our employee will deliver a free debit card with the loan amount already credited.  
If you already have an Alfa-Bank card, we’ll link the loan to it and credit the money.  
You can also visit any Alfa-Bank branch to sign the agreement. There, you'll receive a free debit card with the loan amount in the account.
[Alfa-Bank branch locations]  
You can withdraw cash from this card at an ATM, make purchases, or transfer money in the mobile app.

What is a credit card
A credit card is a payment card that allows you to borrow money from the bank.
The amount the bank is willing to lend is called the credit limit.
With the card, you can pay for goods and services (including online and via QR code in stores), withdraw cash from ATMs, make transfers, and repay credit cards from other banks.

How to top up a credit card
Credit cards can be topped up for free:
• In the mobile app or Alfa-Online (Credit card account → Top up)
• Via Alfa-Bank and partner ATMs
• By transfer from cards of other banks
You can transfer money from your own account or another bank’s account. We don’t charge a commission for topping up the card, but the sending bank may.

How to withdraw cash for free from a credit card
The ability to withdraw cash for free depends on your card’s tariff. You can check it in the mobile app or Alfa-Online under Credit card → Tariffs.
Alfa-Bank credit cardholders with the free cash withdrawal feature can withdraw up to ₽50,000 per month without commission. The limit resets on the 1st of each month. If you withdraw more than ₽50,000 per month, a commission is charged only on the excess. For example, if you withdraw ₽70,000, you’ll pay a commission on ₽20,000.
If the card does not include the free withdrawal feature, any cash withdrawal will incur a commission according to the tariff.
Whether a grace period applies to cash withdrawals depends on your contract terms, available in the mobile app or Alfa-Online → Credit card account → Interest-free period.

How to get a credit card
You can apply for a credit card online:
• On the website. Choose a suitable card, fill out the form, and wait for bank approval. We’ll deliver the physical card to the branch you specified in the application or via courier.
• In the mobile app or Alfa-Online. If you already have an account with us, order a card via the Alfa-Online app: All my products → New account or product.

What is a minimum payment
A minimum payment is the portion of your credit debt that must be paid each month, even within the grace period. It may include interest if the operation is outside the grace period or no grace applies.
The minimum payment is 3–10% of your debt, but no less than ₽300. If your debt is under ₽300, you need to repay the entire amount.
If the minimum payment is not made, the grace period ends, and interest will be charged on the entire debt.
You can check the amount and due date of the minimum payment in the mobile app or Alfa-Online → Credit details. A push notification will be sent one day before the payment is due.

If the grace period has ended
If you don’t repay the debt during the grace period, interest will be charged for using the credit. Interest is calculated on the full amount and for the full usage period.
The interest rate can be viewed in the mobile app or Alfa-Online → Credit card account → Tariffs.
Grace period terms are under Credit card account → Interest-free period.

When will the grace period reset after repayment
The grace period resets during the day after full repayment of the debt.
Check the update in the mobile app or Alfa-Online → Credit card account → Interest-free period.
If there’s no grace period end date shown, that means everything is paid. A new grace period will start from the date of your next qualifying transaction.

How many days the grace period lasts
At Alfa-Bank, the grace period duration depends on the type of credit card.
It may cover all operations (purchases, cash withdrawals, transfers, repayment of another bank’s card) or only purchases and repayment of another bank’s card.
Check grace period terms in the mobile app or Alfa-Online → Credit card account → Interest-free period.
The grace period starts from the date of the qualifying transaction.

Where you can pay with a credit card
• At any establishment with a terminal (including via QR code): cafes, shops, salons, pharmacies, hospitals, cinemas.
If there’s no terminal, you can withdraw cash from the nearest ATM or transfer money to the seller via the mobile app.
• Online. You can use your credit card for online purchases (including via QR code) and link it to online services — taxis, streaming platforms, and more.
If linked, you won’t need to enter the card number each time — payments will go through automatically.

How to transfer money from a credit card
You can transfer money by phone number or card number, between your own accounts via the mobile app or Alfa-Online in the “Payments” section.
The commission for transfers by card number is 5.9% + ₽390;
By phone number or between your own accounts — 5.9% of the amount + ₽150.

Will service fees be charged while the credit agreement is being terminated?
No, if the card is immediately closed. You won’t be able to use it and won’t owe anything.

You can view the fee in the mobile app or Alfa-Online: Credit card → Tariffs.

What is overdraft?
Overdraft or technical overdraft is a debt that arises if you spend more money than was available in your account.
When you pay with a card, the money isn't immediately withdrawn from your account. You can’t use it anymore, but the actual withdrawal happens when the recipient's bank confirms the transaction. If it’s not confirmed within 9 days, we return the funds to your account. If the transaction is confirmed after that, we will withdraw the returned funds again. If there’s not enough money in the account at that moment, an overdraft occurs.
An overdraft can also happen if:
- the transaction was confirmed more than 9 days later,
- we charged a fee according to the tariff for a service,
- the final amount changes due to currency conversion when shopping abroad,
- the merchant requests a higher amount after a hold (e.g., car rental, hotel payment),
- you paid for transportation — terminals often report payment delays.
We charge a fee for overdraft — 20% of the amount, 30 days after it appears.

How to get a certificate or statement for a debit card?
You can get it in the mobile app or Alfa-Online: Card account → Certificates and statements.
A PDF certificate with signature and blue seal will be sent to your email and also available in the mobile app or online banking.
It holds the same legal power as a paper certificate.

Where can you pay with a debit card?
- Anywhere there’s a payment terminal: cafés, stores, salons, pharmacies, hospitals, cinemas.
  If there’s no terminal, you can withdraw cash at the nearest ATM, transfer money to the seller via the mobile app, or pay using a QR code.
- Online. You can pay for online purchases with your debit card, and link it to services like taxi, streaming, etc.
  If you link the card, you don’t need to enter its number each time — payment goes through automatically.

Which payment systems do you issue cards from?
We issue Mir cards. You can check which one is available to you in the mobile app, Alfa-Online, or on the website.

How to close an account linked to a card?
Select it on the main screen of the app or Alfa-Online: Actions → Close account.
The remaining balance can be transferred to another account, sent to your mobile, or withdrawn in cash.
If there’s a debt, it must be repaid.
The account will be fully closed in 45 days.
If it's the main or only account, you can close it only by phone:
+7 495 788 88 78 for Moscow and Moscow Region,
8 800 200 00 00 for other cities,
or at an Alfa-Bank branch.

How to close a card?
On the main screen of the mobile app or Alfa-Online, go to All my products → Card → Close card.
We’ll close the card instantly, and if there was a service fee, we won’t charge it anymore.
The account linked to the card will remain open.
You can use it without a card, link another card, or close it.

Can’t pick up the card at the scheduled time or place. What to do?
Change the time and delivery address in the mobile app, Alfa-Online, or by phone:
+7 495 78-888-78 for Moscow and MO,
8 800 200-00-00 for regions.
If you want to switch from branch pickup to courier delivery or vice versa — call the contact center and we’ll help.
You can track when the card will be ready in the mobile app or via the link we send in an SMS or push notification.

How to reissue or block a card?
If the card stopped working, you can reissue it in the app, Alfa-Online, or via the contact center:
+7 495 78-888-78 for Moscow and MO,
8 800 200-00-00 for regions.
You don’t need to reissue the card due to expiration — the validity has been extended until December 2028.
When paying online, use the old expiration date.  
Important: some stores haven’t updated their terminal settings, and the payment may not go through. In that case, just order a new card.
If the card is lost, you can block and reissue it in the app or Alfa-Online.
If you find the card, you can unblock it there as well and continue using it.

How to order a card?
You can do this online:
— On the website. Choose the card that suits you, click Order Card, and fill in your details.
  We’ll issue the card immediately — you can transfer money in the app or pay online the same day.
  Delivery takes a few days in any city with Alfa-Bank presence. You can check delivery availability during the application.
— In the mobile app, Alfa-Online, or via the contact center:
  +7 495 78-888-78 for Moscow and MO,
  8 800 200-00-00 for regions.  
If you already have an account with us, you can issue additional debit cards, though there’s a limit on how many per person.
To order a new card in the app or Alfa-Online, go to: All my products → New account or product.
You can also get an unnamed card directly at a branch — we’ll make it in ten minutes without a prior order.
When ordering, you can choose whether you want a physical card or only a digital version.
If you already have a digital card, you cannot get a physical one for it — you’ll need to order a new card.

Why didn’t I get cashback?
- You returned the item or canceled the purchase.
- You didn’t click the button inside the partner’s offer.
- Cashback period hasn’t come yet. Usually, we pay on the 10th, but the partner might have their own schedule.
- You added items to the cart in advance. Before purchase, you need to clear the cart and add the items again by clicking Go to shopping.
- You missed one of the cashback conditions — some offers apply only in certain cities or have a minimum purchase amount.

How to get cashback from partners?
Go to the partner’s card and carefully read the conditions.
All offers are available in the mobile app or Alfa-Online under Partner Offers.
Make the purchase while following all cashback rules.
It’s better to disable VPN — some offers may not work otherwise.
We credit cashback on the 10th of each month.
There’s no cap on our side, but the partner may set their own limit — details are in the offer card.

What is a debit card?
A debit card is a card with your own money on it.
You can receive salary or pension to it, withdraw cash, transfer money, or pay for purchases.
You can top up the card at a bank branch, ATM, or by transfer from another account.

What’s the difference between an unnamed and a named card?
An unnamed card is the same as a regular named Alfa debit card:
The named card has the cardholder’s name and surname printed, the unnamed one doesn’t.
The unnamed card is also free, with transfers and payments without fees, and cashback up to 100% in the super cashback wheel, and 5% in 4 categories or 3 categories + 1% on everything.
But the main benefit — you can start using it much sooner: pick it up in a branch within 10 minutes without pre-ordering. If delivery is needed — we’ll bring it the same day.

How is a debit card different from a credit card?
Only your own money is stored on a debit card.
A credit card has a limit — money you can borrow from the bank and pay back later.
You can’t do that with a debit card.
If you don’t have an active credit card, we may offer up to 100,000 rubles in installments for daily expenses — detailed terms are in the mobile app.

What is a debit card for?
- To pay for purchases. You can pay anywhere that has a terminal. Also online or in apps. Alfa-Bank rewards you with bonuses, miles, or up to 100% cashback for payments with a debit card.
- To transfer to your own or others’ accounts — for example, to repay a friend or chip in for a gift.
  You can transfer card-to-card, by account details, or by phone number using the Fast Payment System.
- To pay bills — for utilities, internet, or mobile balance top-up.
- To withdraw cash from ATMs.
- To receive salary, pension, or benefits.

It is important for us to ensure equal opportunities for everyone, regardless of gender, age, racial or ethnic background, religion, or many other characteristics. We do not tolerate any form of discrimination.

This policy applies to all bank employees, including managers at all levels, as well as business partners—suppliers, contractors, and other stakeholders.
We have implemented leading international practices to combat inequality. These practices are used in our daily work and are constantly being improved.

Alfa-Bank’s Equal Opportunity Policy outlines our values, principles, and how this policy is applied in practice.

Our Principles

We strive to create and maintain a culture of mutual respect among employees, clients, partners, and other stakeholders.


We value every employee equally regardless of their type of employment or work schedule, including employees on parental leave.


We respect and value employees and clients with disabilities and aim to create an inclusive environment that is comfortable for everyone.


In hiring, we are guided by principles of equality, gender and cultural diversity, and intolerance of any discrimination. We consider internal candidates on an equal basis with external applicants and make decisions based on professional qualifications and experience.


We make decisions on appointments and compensation based on knowledge, experience, and skills. Favoritism and selective promotion—including based on family ties—are unacceptable.


We guarantee equal pay for equal work and do not allow pay discrimination based on gender, age, or any other attribute.


Employees returning from parental leave have the same career development opportunities as all other employees.


We provide equal access to events, training, and opportunities for professional and personal development, making decisions solely based on knowledge, experience, and skills.


We want everyone to be heard. We organize teamwork in such a way that employees can openly express their opinions and voice concerns or difficulties.


We strive to increase diversity at all levels of the organization, including increasing the proportion of women in leadership positions.

MEMO
FOR CONSUMERS OF PERSONAL LOANS

I. Deciding to take a personal loan – a responsible decision
A personal loan is a loan provided by a bank for the purchase of goods (works, services) for personal, household, or other non-production-related needs.
Obtaining a loan involves the obligation to repay, within the timeframes established by the loan agreement, the principal amount (the sum received from the bank), as well as interest for the use of the loan.
Loan agreements often also include obligations to make other payments associated with obtaining and repaying the loan, both to the bank (e.g. fees for reviewing loan documents, opening and maintaining a bank account, transferring funds, etc.) and to third parties (e.g. payments related to insurance, collateral agreements, money transfers through postal services or other banks, etc.).
If any payments stipulated by the loan agreement are not made, or are made late and/or not in full, the bank may demand a penalty (fine, interest). The bank’s right to demand such a penalty is usually stated in the loan agreement.
Before deciding to take a personal loan, assess your actual need for the loan and your ability to service it on time—that is, how much money you can realistically allocate from your budget to make all required payments under the loan agreement.

II. Carefully study all information about the loan
and the terms of its servicing (repayment)
To make an informed decision about taking a personal loan, you should receive from bank employees complete information about the terms of the loan, including all payments associated with obtaining and servicing (repaying) the loan—without exception.
Important! Your right to receive timely (prior to signing the loan agreement), necessary, and accurate information is enshrined in federal law (Article 10 of the Law of the Russian Federation "On Protection of Consumer Rights", Article 30 of the Federal Law "On Banks and Banking Activity").
This information includes: the loan amount, repayment schedule, the full cost of the loan as an annual percentage rate (this includes your loan-related payments as defined in the agreement, including payments to third parties listed in the agreement).
Carefully review the lending terms. Pay attention to any references to the bank’s service fees. Request and study information about these fees from the bank employees.
To make the best decision, consider reviewing offers from several banks that provide personal loans. This information will help you compare loan terms across banks.

III. Carefully study the loan agreement
and other documents
Do not rush to sign the documents. Before signing the loan agreement, study it thoroughly. If possible, take the agreement home to study it more carefully. Pay close attention to the clauses that define your obligations (duties, liabilities), and make sure the agreement does not contain any terms that you are unaware of or do not fully understand.
If any lending terms are unclear to you, request explanations and relevant documents from bank employees—ask any questions that concern you.
If you do not receive sufficient clarification, it is better to postpone the decision to take the loan.
We also recommend reporting this issue to ___ (insert name of the local office of the Bank of Russia) at the address: ______ (insert address of the local office of the Bank of Russia).
Your feedback will contribute to improving the quality of supervision over banks and enhancing their performance.
When submitting a loan application to the bank, keep in mind that this application may be considered your offer to enter into a loan agreement under the terms specified in the application.
Acceptance of this application by the bank constitutes a loan agreement without additional notification to you.
After reviewing the loan agreement, carefully weigh all the pros and cons of obtaining the loan and objectively assess your ability to repay it on time and fulfill all related payment obligations.

IV. Signing the loan agreement –
the most crucial stage
Important! By signing the loan agreement (or offer application), you agree to all its terms and accept the obligations set out in it, including repaying the principal on time and paying all amounts due.
If you fail to meet these obligations (or perform them improperly), the bank may take legal action against you.
Only sign the loan agreement (or any other bank documents) if you are confident that you understand all its terms, clearly know what payments you must make and when, and are certain that you will be able to meet these obligations.

Why It Matters
We conduct our activities in accordance with high ethical, social, and environmental standards.
We expect the same strict requirements from our suppliers.
This Code applies to all current and future suppliers, their subsidiaries, and other partners with whom we maintain or intend to establish business relationships.
The purpose of this Code is to communicate our expectations regarding collaboration and to encourage suppliers not only to comply with legal regulations but also to follow best practices in ethics, social responsibility, and environmental stewardship, extending these practices throughout the entire supply chain.
As the implementation of the Code provisions takes time, we are always open to dialogue with our business partners to agree on a realistic timeline for full compliance.
The Code should be considered in conjunction with the Corporate Ethics Code, the Equal Opportunity Policy, the Human Rights Policy, and the Anti-Corruption Policy.
As one of the leaders in the Russian banking sector, we acknowledge our responsibility to clients, employees, partners, and society as a whole.
We understand that our partner companies vary in size, maturity, and the extent of their impact on society and the environment. While most provisions of the Code are mandatory by law, some serve as recommendations aimed at improving our partners' practices.

Our Values
We expect suppliers to strictly comply with the laws of the Russian Federation and recommend that they take into account the principles and provisions of international documents (see the list of supported international declarations).
We value the implementation of sustainable development best practices by our suppliers and adherence to the principles we follow ourselves.

Environmental Protection

Suppliers are expected to comply with all environmental protection laws, including those on handling hazardous waste and materials.

Suppliers should implement operational principles that minimize environmental harm.

We plan to develop training materials to educate both procurement staff and suppliers about the Code’s requirements. The Sustainability Committee will evaluate the results and effectiveness of these initiatives.
We will also collaborate with non-profit organizations, government bodies, and other companies, participate in relevant events and expert forums to promote responsible practices among partners in our supply chain.
Together with suppliers, we will define goals and timelines for implementing the Code’s requirements. We will also establish regular monitoring procedures to ensure our partners’ compliance.
We plan to develop criteria for evaluating supplier compliance with the Code. These criteria will be used in selective or full assessments of existing partners and included in tender procedures. Assessment results will determine whether to continue or suspend cooperation.
Our results in supplier engagement will be disclosed in our sustainability report (without mentioning specific supplier names or confidential information).


Responsibility
The Supplier Code of Conduct is approved by order of the Chairman of the Management Board in accordance with the Bank’s Charter. The Sustainability Committee is responsible for implementation at the management level.
