How to install the mobile app
You can install the mobile app on smartphones running Android and iOS. iOS users can also use the Alfa-Online internet banking service.
You can download the Android app from our website or from one of the official stores by manufacturers, such as Huawei AppGallery, Xiaomi Market, Galaxy Store, GetApps, RuMarket, Rustore, or NashStore.
Don't worry if you see a warning about an untrusted source during installation — everything is fine, the app is indeed ours; this is a standard notification. Tap Download anyway → Allow installation.
For iPhone users, it is possible to request a bank employee to install the app at home or visit any bank branch. You can request installation through the form on the website.

How to use Alfa-Online
Alfa-Online is a mobile bank that works on all smartphones. It’s just like the app, but you don’t need to download it. Add the icon to your smartphone screen:

Open Alfa-Online in Safari.  
Tap Share at the bottom of the screen.  
Select Add to Home Screen.  
Log in to Alfa-Online using your card number.  
Create a login and password.  
Tap Save password so you don’t have to enter it every time.


What can you do in the app?
Transfer money and pay online.
Send money using a card number or phone number to other banks without commission (within limits). You can always find your card details for online purchases in the app.
Exchange currencies.
If you’re saving in foreign currency, exchange money at a favorable rate.
Earn cashback.
Earn cashback for your purchases and exchange it for rubles in the “All your cashback” section. 1 point = 1 ruble. If your card allows you to earn miles, you’ll find all the details in the same section. The “History” section shows how much you earned for each purchase. Sometimes the details appear a few days after the transaction. You’ll also find additional partner offers with increased cashback and discounts in the “Showcase” section.
Apply for anything: from insurance to a car loan.
You can open an investment account, take out a loan, or get insurance — all within the app, no office visit needed.
Statements and certificates.

Save for anything.
Home renovation, vacation, or a new phone: set up a savings goal and achieve it.
Pay fines.
You can add your car number in the app — this way, you'll get instant notifications about fines and pay them with a 50% discount.
Open deposits, accounts, and savings.
Block and reissue cards, open deposits and savings accounts, in rubles or foreign currency — all online.
Split the bill with friends.
Send your friends or colleagues a link to split a bill at a café or chip in for a gift for your boss.
