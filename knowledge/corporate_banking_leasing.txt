Leasing
Alfa-Bank offers different leasing products such as vehicles, real estate, leaseback, refinancing of existing leasing portfolio on the most favorable terms to large and medium corporate clients.
Leasing provides a number of advantages:
• You save efforts: no collateral is required. The leased asset itself is used as a security.
• You save cash: reduction of profit and property tax base. Leasing payments are charged to the cost in full, thus the income taxable base is reduced. Due to accelerated depreciation, you have savings on property tax.
• You save time: you just choose a leased asset (model of vehicle, equipment, etc.), we organize the deal with all involved parties under the principle of “one entry point”.
