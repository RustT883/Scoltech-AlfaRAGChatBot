SUPPLIER CODE OF CONDUCT

Why It Matters
We conduct our activities in accordance with high ethical, social, and environmental standards.
We expect the same strict requirements from our suppliers.
This Code applies to all current and future suppliers, their subsidiaries, and other partners with whom we maintain or intend to establish business relationships.
The purpose of this Code is to communicate our expectations regarding collaboration and to encourage suppliers not only to comply with legal regulations but also to follow best practices in ethics, social responsibility, and environmental stewardship, extending these practices throughout the entire supply chain.
As the implementation of the Code provisions takes time, we are always open to dialogue with our business partners to agree on a realistic timeline for full compliance.
The Code should be considered in conjunction with the Corporate Ethics Code, the Equal Opportunity Policy, the Human Rights Policy, and the Anti-Corruption Policy.
As one of the leaders in the Russian banking sector, we acknowledge our responsibility to clients, employees, partners, and society as a whole.
We understand that our partner companies vary in size, maturity, and the extent of their impact on society and the environment. While most provisions of the Code are mandatory by law, some serve as recommendations aimed at improving our partners' practices.

Our Values
We expect suppliers to strictly comply with the laws of the Russian Federation and recommend that they take into account the principles and provisions of international documents (see the list of supported international declarations).
We value the implementation of sustainable development best practices by our suppliers and adherence to the principles we follow ourselves.

Environmental Protection

Suppliers are expected to comply with all environmental protection laws, including those on handling hazardous waste and materials.
We welcome suppliers having a public environmental/sustainability policy aligned with their business scale and aimed at reducing environmental impact. The policy should promote resource efficiency: energy, water, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, waste management, biodiversity preservation, etc.
Suppliers are expected to develop internal programs or strategies to mitigate their environmental impact.
Suppliers should implement operational principles that minimize environmental harm.


Occupational Health, Safety, and Labor Protection

Suppliers must fully comply with occupational health and safety laws, ensuring the well-being of their employees.
It is important to us that suppliers take all necessary measures to protect employees' health and lives.
Suppliers are expected to regularly inform employees about occupational health and workplace safety requirements.


Decent Working Conditions and Human Rights Compliance

Suppliers must not use any form of forced labor.
All forms of child labor are prohibited. Employment of young workers must comply with the Labor Code of the Russian Federation or other applicable legislation.
Suppliers are expected to ensure fair wages that allow employees to maintain a decent standard of living and meet their essential needs.
Suppliers must guarantee legally established working hours, and any overtime must be voluntary and reasonably limited.
Suppliers must not allow discrimination of employees on any grounds.
Suppliers must prevent any form of physical or sexual abuse, verbal harassment, intimidation, or other oppressive behavior.
We expect suppliers to maintain clear and fair disciplinary practices and transparent grievance and appeal procedures.
Suppliers must allow employees to form or join trade unions or other free associations and must not interfere with collective bargaining as permitted by law.


Business Ethics Compliance

Suppliers are expected to follow our principles of business ethics, including the Corporate Ethics Code and Anti-Corruption Policy.
Suppliers must ensure the security of financial transactions and prevent any form of money laundering.
Suppliers’ systems should protect the confidentiality and security of customer and employee data, including personal data protection.
Suppliers must inform us promptly of any financial, legal, or other business issues that may compromise their or our business reputation or violate contractual obligations.
Suppliers must combat corruption, bribery, fraud, commercial bribery, and other illegal activities.


How the Code Works

All suppliers, including new business partners, must familiarize themselves with this Code.
We plan to develop training materials to educate both procurement staff and suppliers about the Code’s requirements. The Sustainability Committee will evaluate the results and effectiveness of these initiatives.
We will also collaborate with non-profit organizations, government bodies, and other companies, participate in relevant events and expert forums to promote responsible practices among partners in our supply chain.
Together with suppliers, we will define goals and timelines for implementing the Code’s requirements. We will also establish regular monitoring procedures to ensure our partners’ compliance.
We plan to develop criteria for evaluating supplier compliance with the Code. These criteria will be used in selective or full assessments of existing partners and included in tender procedures. Assessment results will determine whether to continue or suspend cooperation.
Our results in supplier engagement will be disclosed in our sustainability report (without mentioning specific supplier names or confidential information).


Responsibility
The Supplier Code of Conduct is approved by order of the Chairman of the Management Board in accordance with the Bank’s Charter. The Sustainability Committee is responsible for implementation at the management level. It monitors compliance with the Code’s principles and oversees awareness, training, evaluation, complaint handling, and regular reporting.
The Code’s relevance and compliance with legislation and international guidelines are monitored by the Sustainability Committee, which provides recommendations for updates and submits them to the Board of Directors for approval.
