How to activate a card?
In the mobile app or Alfa-Online: All my products → Card account → Set PIN code.

What is overdraft?
Overdraft or technical overdraft is a debt that arises if you spend more money than was available in your account.
When you pay with a card, the money isn't immediately withdrawn from your account. You can’t use it anymore, but the actual withdrawal happens when the recipient's bank confirms the transaction. If it’s not confirmed within 9 days, we return the funds to your account. If the transaction is confirmed after that, we will withdraw the returned funds again. If there’s not enough money in the account at that moment, an overdraft occurs.
An overdraft can also happen if:
- the transaction was confirmed more than 9 days later,
- we charged a fee according to the tariff for a service,
- the final amount changes due to currency conversion when shopping abroad,
- the merchant requests a higher amount after a hold (e.g., car rental, hotel payment),
- you paid for transportation — terminals often report payment delays.
We charge a fee for overdraft — 20% of the amount, 30 days after it appears.

How to get a certificate or statement for a debit card?
You can get it in the mobile app or Alfa-Online: Card account → Certificates and statements.
A PDF certificate with signature and blue seal will be sent to your email and also available in the mobile app or online banking.
It holds the same legal power as a paper certificate.

Where can you pay with a debit card?
- Anywhere there’s a payment terminal: cafés, stores, salons, pharmacies, hospitals, cinemas.
  If there’s no terminal, you can withdraw cash at the nearest ATM, transfer money to the seller via the mobile app, or pay using a QR code.
- Online. You can pay for online purchases with your debit card, and link it to services like taxi, streaming, etc.
  If you link the card, you don’t need to enter its number each time — payment goes through automatically.

Which payment systems do you issue cards from?
We issue Mir cards. You can check which one is available to you in the mobile app, Alfa-Online, or on the website.

How to close an account linked to a card?
Select it on the main screen of the app or Alfa-Online: Actions → Close account.
The remaining balance can be transferred to another account, sent to your mobile, or withdrawn in cash.
If there’s a debt, it must be repaid.
The account will be fully closed in 45 days.
If it's the main or only account, you can close it only by phone:
+7 495 788 88 78 for Moscow and Moscow Region,
8 800 200 00 00 for other cities,
or at an Alfa-Bank branch.

How to close a card?
On the main screen of the mobile app or Alfa-Online, go to All my products → Card → Close card.
We’ll close the card instantly, and if there was a service fee, we won’t charge it anymore.
The account linked to the card will remain open.
You can use it without a card, link another card, or close it.

Can’t pick up the card at the scheduled time or place. What to do?
Change the time and delivery address in the mobile app, Alfa-Online, or by phone:
+7 495 78-888-78 for Moscow and MO,
8 800 200-00-00 for regions.
If you want to switch from branch pickup to courier delivery or vice versa — call the contact center and we’ll help.

How to reissue or block a card?
If the card stopped working, you can reissue it in the app, Alfa-Online, or via the contact center:
+7 495 78-888-78 for Moscow and MO,
8 800 200-00-00 for regions.
You don’t need to reissue the card due to expiration — the validity has been extended until December 2028.
When paying online, use the old expiration date.  
Important: some stores haven’t updated their terminal settings, and the payment may not go through. In that case, just order a new card.
If the card is lost, you can block and reissue it in the app or Alfa-Online.
If you find the card, you can unblock it there as well and continue using it.

If you already have an account with us, you can issue additional debit cards, though there’s a limit on how many per person.
To order a new card in the app or Alfa-Online, go to: All my products → New account or product.
You can also get an unnamed card directly at a branch — we’ll make it in ten minutes without a prior order.
When ordering, you can choose whether you want a physical card or only a digital version.
If you already have a digital card, you cannot get a physical one for it — you’ll need to order a new card.

Why didn’t I get cashback?
- You returned the item or canceled the purchase.
- You didn’t click the button inside the partner’s offer.
- Cashback period hasn’t come yet. Usually, we pay on the 10th, but the partner might have their own schedule.
- You added items to the cart in advance. Before purchase, you need to clear the cart and add the items again by clicking Go to shopping.
- You missed one of the cashback conditions — some offers apply only in certain cities or have a minimum purchase amount.

How to get cashback from partners?
Go to the partner’s card and carefully read the conditions.
All offers are available in the mobile app or Alfa-Online under Partner Offers.
Make the purchase while following all cashback rules.
It’s better to disable VPN — some offers may not work otherwise.
We credit cashback on the 10th of each month.
There’s no cap on our side, but the partner may set their own limit — details are in the offer card.

What is a debit card?
A debit card is a card with your own money on it.
You can receive salary or pension to it, withdraw cash, transfer money, or pay for purchases.
You can top up the card at a bank branch, ATM, or by transfer from another account.

What’s the difference between an unnamed and a named card?
An unnamed card is the same as a regular named Alfa debit card:
The named card has the cardholder’s name and surname printed, the unnamed one doesn’t.
The unnamed card is also free, with transfers and payments without fees, and cashback up to 100% in the super cashback wheel, and 5% in 4 categories or 3 categories + 1% on everything.
But the main benefit — you can start using it much sooner: pick it up in a branch within 10 minutes without pre-ordering. If delivery is needed — we’ll bring it the same day.

How is a debit card different from a credit card?
Only your own money is stored on a debit card.
A credit card has a limit — money you can borrow from the bank and pay back later.
You can’t do that with a debit card.
If you don’t have an active credit card, we may offer up to 100,000 rubles in installments for daily expenses — detailed terms are in the mobile app.

What is a debit card for?
- To pay for purchases. You can pay anywhere that has a terminal. Also online or in apps. Alfa-Bank rewards you with bonuses, miles, or up to 100% cashback for payments with a debit card.
- To transfer to your own or others’ accounts — for example, to repay a friend or chip in for a gift.
  You can transfer card-to-card, by account details, or by phone number using the Fast Payment System.
- To pay bills — for utilities, internet, or mobile balance top-up.
- To withdraw cash from ATMs.
- To receive salary, pension, or benefits.
