Anti-Corruption Policy

Why It Matters
We oppose any actions related to corruption.
Compliance with the law is our unconditional obligation.
Our relationships with counterparties and competitors are based on legal requirements and ethical principles. This approach ensures fair market competition and upholds Alfa-Bank’s strong reputation among clients and business partners.



We strive for our business partners and other stakeholders to follow the principles outlined in this policy.
